Author-Gajendra Bagi
•	Designed and developed user interface with frontend technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and react for better user interaction.
•	Designed and implemented a comprehensive system using Django web framework, to provide information about the number of visitors to a website and the number of page views.
•	Monitored and optimized API performance, identifying and resolving bottlenecks to maintain low response times and high availability.
•	Employed MongoDB for handling unstructured data and enabling fast and efficient retrieval of customer information.
•	Leveraged a server less data integration service to discover, prepare, and combine data easily and detect flaws in data pipelines using AWS Glue and DynamoDB  
•	Developed and maintained Python applications that interacted with MySQL databases for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, ensuring efficient CRUD operations.
•	Responsible in writing microservices using Django to implement crud operations on database to handle and retrieve records of each customer.  
•	Created RESTful API endpoints that communicate data in JSON format, facilitating integration with third-party billing and insurance systems while ensuring data consistency.
•	the system's Python codebase, automating code analysis, unit testing using PyTest, and implementing rollback mechanisms in CI/CD pipelines for quick reversion to previous versions in case of issues.
•	Designed and developed a real-time data pipeline using Apache Kafka enabling timely billing, accurate claims processing, and enhanced patient management within the healthcare environment.
•	Employed Python scripts and OpenShift API client libraries to automate application deployments, configuration, and scaling within OpenShift clusters.
•	Streamlined Docker containers for containerizing files and data on Kubernetes to provide a small runtime without any leakage or loss of data from the server, reducing exposure of runtime environment. 
•	Utilized PySpark streaming capabilities to process real-time data, optimizing data pipelines, accelerated data transformations, and facilitated advanced analytics, enhancing billing accuracy, operational efficiency, and data-driven decision-making within the system.
•	Use Jira to track and manage issues related to the bill management software. Enabling tracking and resolving software bugs, managing feature requests, and addressing user-reported issues promptly.
•	Utilized Git's version tracking capabilities to maintain a comprehensive history of changes to the system, facilitating easier debugging and troubleshooting in case of issues.
•	Implemented Agile practices like user story estimation, task breakdown, and sprint goal alignment within Python development tasks, ensuring transparency and alignment with team objectives.
•	Performed unit testing on individual component of the software using PyTest to ascertain if they are fit to use.
